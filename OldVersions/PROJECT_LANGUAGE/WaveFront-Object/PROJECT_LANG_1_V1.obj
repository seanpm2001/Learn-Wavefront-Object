# Notes
# I don't know how to make strings in WaveFront-Object, so comments will do for now

# Project language file 1
# For: seanpm2001/Learn-WaveFront-Object
# About:
# I decided to make WaveFront-Object the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-WaveFront-Object) as WaveFront-Object is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the WaveFront-Object programming language. It only makes sense to make WaveFront-Object the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
